The Si5338 is a programmable i2c clock generators with up to 4 output
clocks. It has 4 sets of possible input clocks

IN1/IN2: differential
IN3: single-ended
IN4: single-ended
IN5/IN6: differential

Additionally, IN1/IN2 can be used as XTAL with different setting.
The clock tree looks like below (without support of zero-delay)


      IN1/IN2 IN3         IN4 IN5/IN6

   |       |   |   |   |   |    |

       OUT0  OUT1  OUT2  OUT3

The output clock can choose from any of the above clock as its source, with
exceptions: MS1 can only be used for OUT1, MS2 can only be used for OUT2, MS3
can only be used for OUT3.

==I2C device node==

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be "silabs,si5338".
- reg: i2c device address, shall be 0x60, 0x61, 0x70, or 0x71
- #clock-cells: shall be set to 1 for multiple outputs
- clocks: list of parent clocks in the order of <xtal>, <in1/2>, <in3>, <in4>,
	 <in5/6>.
	Note, xtal and in1/2 are mutually exclusive. Only one can be set.
- clock-names: The name of the clocks in the same order.
- #address-cells: shall be set to 1.
- #size-cells: shall be set to 0.
- silabs,pll-master: If PLL is used, pick one MS (0, 1, 2, or 3) to allow
	chaning PLL rate. This is arbitrary since MS0/1/2/3 share one PLL.
	PLL can be calculated backward to satisfy MS. This node is not
	required if PLL is not used, or if silabs,pll-vco is set.

Optional properties if not set by platform driver:
- silab,name-prefix: name prefix for si5338
        If multiple si5338 chips exist, use name-prefix to form unique names.
	If omitted, i2c bus name will be used as the prefix.
- silab,ref-source: source of refclk, valid value is defined as
	#define SI5338_REF_SRC_CLKIN12          0
	#define SI5338_REF_SRC_CLKIN3           1
	#define SI5338_REF_SRC_XTAL             4
- silab,fb-source:  source of fbclk, valid value is defined as
	#define SI5338_FB_SRC_CLKIN4            2
	#define SI5338_FB_SRC_CLKIN56           3
	#define SI5338_FB_SRC_NOCLK             5
- silabs,pll-source: source of pll, valid value is defined as
	#define SI5338_PFD_IN_REF_REFCLK           0
	#define SI5338_PFD_IN_REF_FBCLK            1
	#define SI5338_PFD_IN_REF_DIVREFCLK        2
	#define SI5338_PFD_IN_REF_DIVFBCLK         3
	#define SI5338_PFD_IN_REF_XOCLK            4
	#define SI5338_PFD_IN_REF_NOCLK            5
- silabs,pll-vco: Specify VCO frequency for optimal ratios for all outputs.
	If specified, silabs,pll-master is ignored.

==Child nodes==

Each of the clock outputs can be configured individually by
using a child node to the I2C device node. If a child node for a clock
output is not set, platform driver has to set up.

Required child node properties:
- name: name for the child node
        It has to be unique. The name prefix is ignored.
	If using platform data and the name is not specificed,
        clkout0/1/2/3 will be used with name prefix.
- reg: number of clock output.

Optional child node properties:
- silabs,drive-config: the configuration of output driver
  The valid value list is long. Please refer to soruce code.
- silabs,clock-source: source clock of the output divider
	#define SI5338_OUT_MUX_FBCLK            0
	#define SI5338_OUT_MUX_REFCLK           1
	#deinfe SI5338_OUT_MUX_DIVFBCLK         2
	#deinfe SI5338_OUT_MUX_DIVREFCLK        3
	#deinfe SI5338_OUT_MUX_XOCLK            4
	#deinfe SI5338_OUT_MUX_MS0              5
	#deinfe SI5338_OUT_MUX_MSN              6 /* MS0/1/2/3 */
	#deinfe SI5338_OUT_MUX_NOCLK            7
- silabs,disable-state : clock output disable state, shall be
	#define SI5338_OUT_DIS_HIZ              0
	#define SI5338_OUT_DIS_LOW              1
	#define SI5338_OUT_DIS_HI               2
	#define SI5338_OUT_DIS_ALWAYS_ON        3
- enabled: the output is enabled by default
	The existence of this node enables the output when the driver is loaded
	otherwise the clock is only enabled when used
